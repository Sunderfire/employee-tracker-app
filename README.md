# employee-tracker-app

## Description

In this UofT fullstack coding bootcamp challenge, I have written a command line application that tracks employee data in a mysql database.  It challenged my understanding of mysql, ability to write a schema for the database and then seed it.  It also challenged my understanding of how to then interact with and manipulate that database.  

## Usage

Run the application with node index.js.  You will then be shown the main menu, which is a list prompt that lets you choose several options.  You can view departments, roles, or employees, and also add to these as well.  Additionally you can update the role of an employee and close the application.
